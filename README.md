# insight-aggregator

Small project workspace with `client/` and `server/` folders. This repository is currently empty — use the `client` folder for frontend code and the `server` folder for backend code.

Getting started

1. Create code in `client/` or `server/` according to your chosen stack (Node, Python, etc.).
2. Commit and push to GitHub (see below for example commands):

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project files"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <your-github-remote-url>
git push -u origin main
```

If you'd like, I can create the remote repository on GitHub for you and push the initial commit (I will need permission or the GitHub repository URL / `gh` authentication).
